<h1>About This Site</h1>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is a tool for players of <a href="https://www.elitedangerous.com/">Elite Dangerous</a>, explorers traversing the galaxy. 
    If you are at a point A (let's say Sol, home of Earth) and you plan to visit point B (let's say the Colonia settlement), you might pass by many 
    other interesting places en route without even knowing. If you don't mind a few extra jumps to see some spectacular interstellar sights, use
    this tool to find them!</p>
<p>Simply type in your current position and destination (either the system name as it appears in Elite Dangerous or the Point of Interest name as known
    by <a href="https://www.edsm.net">EDSM</a>), how far your ship can jump, and how many extra jumps you are willing to consider, and click Search.</p>

<h3>Who wrote it?</h3>
<p>This tool was written by <strong>Keir MacDonald</strong>, a .NET software developer based in the South of England, occasional Elite Dangerous ship commander, and
    loyal supporter of the <a href="http://elite-dangerous.wikia.com/wiki/Empire">Empire.</a> You can find contact details on my 
    <a href="https://kamd.me.uk">personal website</a>.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>This project is an experiment in using <a href="https://blazor.net">Blazor</a>, a client-side web framework written in C#/Razor, with an ASP.NET Core
    backend. The Elite Dangerous galaxy data it uses comes from the <a href="https://www.edsm.net">Elite Dangerous Star Map</a> project, without which
    this tool would not be possible.</p>
